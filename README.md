## Overview

I just tried to recreate the challenge by my way, so, it can be good for me but not for someone who knows more about HTML and CSS, so, if it is something i must change please tell me. Thanks.

### The challenge

The card can be seen well in a desktop and a mobile.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

One of the things i learned it's how to put the icon view on the "main" image
and how to change the opacity of it when you put the cursor in the image.

### Continued development

I just want to have a good level of HTML and CSS and go for JavaScript, so if someone can help me commenting my errors, thank you.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/) - This page helped me for understand some many commands.
